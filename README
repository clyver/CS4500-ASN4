How to Compile and Run:

  To run this program and compare your audio files,
  run one of the following commands:

    ./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -f <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -f <pathname>

   -Where <pathname> is a Linux path name.  If a <pathname> is
    preceded by "-f", then the <pathname> must end in ".wav" or
    ".mp3" or ".ogg" and must name a file that already exists on
    the CCIS shared file system.  If a <pathname> is preceded by
    "-d", it must name a directory that already exists on the
    CCIS shared file system and contains nothing but files whose
    pathnames would be legal following a "-f" option.

   If two audio files match, you will be notified by 'MATCH' along with 
   the file names and the times at which the match occurs.   

   We assume the user has all necessary permissions.

Third Party Software:
    We did not use any third paty software,
     only the CCIS available libraries.
