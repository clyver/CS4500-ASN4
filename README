How to Compile and Run:

To this program and compare your WAV files, run one of the following commands:
    ./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -f <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -f <pathname>

   - Where <pathname> is a Linux path name.  If a <pathname> is
   preceded by "-f", then the <pathname> must end in ".wav" or
   ".mp3" and must name a file that already exists on the CCIS
   shared file system.  If a <pathname> is preceded by "-d", it
   must name a directory that already exists on the CCIS shared
   file system and contains nothing but files whose pathnames
   would be legal following a "-f" option.

   We assume the user has all the necessary permissions.

Third Party Software:
    We did not use any third paty software, only the CCIS available libraries.
